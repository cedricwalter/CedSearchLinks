PLG_CONTENT_CEDSEARCHLINKS_DESC="<img src="../media/galaxiis/assets/images/galaxiis-logo.jpg" class="img-padding" /><h1>CedSearchLinks</h1><p> CedSearchLinks plugin for Joomla! is executed in all components that supports content plugins, including Joomla! articles and K2 Items. It searches for #anything and replaces it with a link over the hashtag that goes directly to either the search component or to the smart search (finder) or to the tag component. When clicking on tag #anything, results will display all articles that contain "anything" and not only the ones with the hashtag in it.</p>"
